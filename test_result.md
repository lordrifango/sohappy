# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The system requires exact format matches for phone numbers, which causes problems when users search with slightly different formats (e.g., with/without spaces, with/without leading zeros). Created multiple test users with different phone formats and confirmed that searching with a different format than what was used during registration fails. This explains the user's reported issue of not being able to find their other account. Recommendation: Implement phone number normalization in both frontend and backend code to remove spaces and non-digit characters before storing and searching."

        comment: "Comprehensive testing confirms there is an issue with phone number normalization. While the normalize_phone() function correctly handles spaces and hyphens in phone numbers, it has a flaw in handling leading zeros. When a phone number with a leading zero is normalized, the zero is removed, but when searching with a number that has an extra digit at the beginning (e.g., '012345678' instead of '12345678'), the search still finds the user because the leading '0' is removed. This inconsistent behavior can cause confusion for users. The normalize_phone() function needs to be updated to ensure consistent behavior with extra digits."

  - agent: "testing"
    message: "❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Identified a critical issue with phone number format handling in the user search functionality. The system requires exact format matches for phone numbers, which causes problems when users search with slightly different formats (e.g., with/without spaces, with/without leading zeros). Created multiple test users with different phone formats and confirmed that searching with a different format than what was used during registration fails. This explains the user's reported issue of not being able to find their other account. Comprehensive tests show that only exact format matches work, while variations like adding spaces or changing the leading zero fail. Recommendation: Implement phone number normalization in both frontend and backend code to remove spaces and non-digit characters before storing and searching."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "🔍 COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: Verified all GetStream backend functionality is working correctly for token generation, channel creation, and message sending. However, identified two critical issues: 1) The phone number normalization function has a flaw in handling leading zeros, causing inconsistent search results. 2) There's an issue when creating direct message channels with members from other users - the channel creation fails with 'Erreur lors de la création du canal'. These issues need to be fixed for proper user search and direct messaging functionality. Recommendation: Update the normalize_phone() function to ensure consistent behavior with extra digits, and fix the channel creation endpoint to properly handle members from other users."
