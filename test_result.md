# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Added success message for cagnotte creation. Enhanced TontineCard with type differentiation (🎯 Personal Goals, 💰 Cagnottes, 🏛️ Tontines) and sharing functionality. Users can now share objectives via native share API or clipboard. Progress bar shows red warning when limit reached for free users. All objectives (tontines, personal goals, cagnottes) now display in unified dashboard with appropriate icons and actions."

    message: "CRITICAL BUG FIX: User reported ability to create 4th objective while being in free mode (should be limited to 3). Root cause: Logic was checking separate limits (3 tontines + 1 goal + 1 fund = 5 total allowed). Fixed by implementing unified limit of 3 TOTAL objectives for free users. Modified PremiumContext to use totalObjectives: 3, updated all canCreate functions to check total count, updated Dashboard display. Now correctly prevents creation of 4th objective for free users."

    message: "Completed testing of the backend authentication system after dashboard modifications. All authentication endpoints are still working correctly. The tests verified that /api/auth/send-code accepts phone numbers and country codes and returns session IDs, /api/auth/verify-code validates 6-digit codes and rejects invalid formats, and /api/auth/check-session/{session_id} correctly validates sessions and returns user information. MongoDB connectivity is working properly with user sessions being stored and retrieved correctly. Performance tests show good response times: send-code (avg: 19.20ms), verify-code (avg: 49.26ms), and check-session (avg: 30.67ms). The authentication system is stable and working as expected after the dashboard modifications."

    message: "Completed verification testing of the backend authentication system after the objectives limit bug fix. All authentication endpoints are still working correctly with no regressions. MongoDB connectivity is intact and performance is good with average response times: send-code (49.90ms), verify-code (21.95ms), and check-session (28.37ms). The frontend changes to fix the objectives limit did not impact backend functionality. All tests passed successfully."

    message: "CRITICAL COMPONENT ERROR FIXED: User reported component error. Found and fixed duplicate icon component declarations in components.js file. There were 3 declarations of BellIcon, UserIcon, XMarkIcon and other icon components causing 'Identifier has already been declared' parsing errors. Removed two complete duplicate sections (lines 3295-3427) while keeping the original correct icon definitions around line 2411. Frontend now compiles successfully without errors. All services running properly."

    message: "MULTIPLE UI IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETED: 1) Updated authentication screens colors from emerald to violet (#5C6BC0) to match app theme, 2) Fixed share button error in objective cards with better error handling and fallbacks for older browsers, 3) Removed 'Contacter le support' option from floating action button, 4) Made floating action button truly draggable across entire screen with touch and mouse support - users can now position it wherever they want while maintaining default bottom-right position. Button shows drag indicator and maintains smooth animations. All changes tested and working correctly."

    message: "Implemented user profile API endpoints. Added models for user profiles (UserProfile, UserProfileCreate, UserProfileUpdate) with proper validation. Created three new endpoints: POST /api/profile/create for creating profiles after authentication, GET /api/profile/{session_id} for retrieving profiles, and PUT /api/profile/{session_id} for updating profiles. All endpoints validate session_id and handle errors appropriately. Profiles are stored in MongoDB and linked to user sessions via phone number and country code."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the new profile API endpoints. All three endpoints are working correctly: 1) POST /api/profile/create successfully creates profiles with valid data and properly handles validation errors, duplicate profiles, and invalid sessions. 2) GET /api/profile/{session_id} correctly retrieves profiles and handles non-existent profiles and invalid sessions. 3) PUT /api/profile/{session_id} successfully updates profiles while preserving unchanged fields and properly handles non-existent profiles and invalid sessions. The existing authentication endpoints continue to work correctly with the profile integration. MongoDB connectivity is working properly with profiles being stored and retrieved correctly. Performance tests show good response times across all endpoints. All tests passed successfully."
